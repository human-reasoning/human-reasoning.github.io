We are actively seeking 🤝 collaborators and 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 new team members. If you are interested in working together, please get in touch! 

We are not currently recruiting post-graduate research assistants, graduate students, or postdoctoral fellows, but please check back soon or inquire to be kept in the loop!

## Before Contacting Us 🤔

The best arrangements are mutually beneficial: They advance your career while moving the laboratory's mission forward. Before inquiring, take a few minutes to reflect on:

1. **Your long-term career goal**. If we meet, we will discuss your expectations and decide whether they are achievable within the lab’s current project timelines so that you can make an informed decision. Successful lab members have a clear vision of how working with us will help them achieve their career goal.

2. **What capabilities you bring.** We work with human intracranial EEG, gaze tracking, computational neural models, and structural connectivity data primarily in Python (and, to a lesser extent, R and MATLAB). Successful lab members usually have previous experience in neuroelectrophysiology, but we are open to diverse technical backgrounds.

## How to Contact Us ✉️

Please email us at [humanreasoning.lab@gmail.com](mailto:humanreasoning.lab@gmail.com) with:

- A short pitch that addresses the two points above
- Your availability and expected duration of your commitment
- Your Curriculum Vitae (attached as a PDF file)

If you seem like a good match, we will follow up to schedule an interview!
