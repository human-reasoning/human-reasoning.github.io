## ⭐ Our Mission 🚀

The Laboratory for Human Reasoning is a mission-driven cognitive neuroscience laboratory dedicated to the study of human reasoning. Our mission is to construct a faithful computational model of the mesoscale neural dynamics of reasoning in the human brain. We are building toward a future in which the neural computations underlying reasoning can be formally described and used to inform clinical and technological innovation.

## 🔍 Our Scientific Philosophy 🧩

Our mission is the organizing principle of the laboratory. It shapes our approach to science and our definition of progress. We embark upon projects as strategic steps toward accomplishing the mission, and we view publications as byproducts along the way — not ends in themselves. We believe that great science requires a healthy environment, so we strive to cultivate a place where people enjoy their work, feel secure in their role, and trust their colleagues. We evaluate performance based on process, not outcome. Major scientific discoveries often involve luck, but you can't be lucky without disciplined and organized scientific inquiry.

## 🧠 How We Work 💻

We pursue the mission through three tightly linked efforts, running in parallel: First, we use human neuroimaging to construct structural connectivity maps of the brain circuits that support reasoning. Second, we implement neural models on top of these structural circuits to simulate reasoning computations. Third, we iteratively test and update these models against empirical human behavioral and neural data collected during reasoning tasks.
